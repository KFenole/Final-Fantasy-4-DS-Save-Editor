# Final Fantasy IV (Nintendo DS) Save Editor
## Version 0.3 Beta

This project is currently in beta.

Current Features:
- View/Edit Character Stats (Cecil, Rydia and Tellah only for now)
- View/Edit Inventory (most items excluding weapons and key items)
- View/Edit Gil

Features Planned:
- Add all characters
- Add all weapons and items
- Heal/Modify Status conditons
- Add/remove character skills
- Allow opening of file from anywhere
- A User Interface

Known Issues:
- When inputting a number, if your input starts with a number then includes illegal characters, the program will break.

As this project is still in beta, you may encounter other bugs, which I urge you to share. Thanks!

How to use:
Compile using g++, Visual Studio or any C++ compiler, then run from the same directory as your save file, named 'FF4.sav'. As the program exits beta, I will make it more and more user friendly. 
At the moment I don't offer any downloads, just the source. However once the project is out of beta, I will have executables for Mac and Windows available to download here.
